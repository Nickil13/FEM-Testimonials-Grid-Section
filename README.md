## My process

I started the project mobile-first, splitting up the HTML semantically. Then working on each component separately, the header of the testimonial, the text, then the grid postioning.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS boilerplate
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Using SCSS for a small project

### Continued development

I want to try new ways of implementing features I've done before so I don't get stuck doing the same thing over and over again.

- e.g. Using grid-template-area instead of specifying each grid item's position.
